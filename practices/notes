// npm install package_name -save will automatically save the that dependency
in package.json file under dependency section.
so if someone else is running our code on there system then they can easily download 
all those listed dependency using one single command
$ npm install

so package.json helps us in keep track of the dependency needed or used in our
project

we can create this json file when we create a new project an run this command
$ npm init

#nodemon

it is package which keeps track of all the application file 
such that if we make any changes to any of the app file it will automatically
restart the server reflecting the changes. no need to stop and start again

command to install is
$ npm install -g nodemon
-g tag tell us that it will be installed globally on our system not just for a specific 
project, so might have to use sudo

there is change now, instead of typing "node app.js" now we need to type 
"nodemon app.js".
